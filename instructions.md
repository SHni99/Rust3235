# Course Project of CS3235

Please see the slides "Course Project Introduction.pptx" ([Canvas link](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/52891/files/folder/Project?preview=3980180)). Feel free to ask questions on Canvas discussion. This clarification slides ([Google link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eDMBxjoowpcNnDr2uzLOpm2wXXVEnMfSLPlSWWffAck/edit?usp=sharing)) will promptly categorize existing discussions for your convenience.

1. Set up the environment according to the "Course Project Env Setup" slide ([Canvas link](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/52891/files/folder/Project?preview=3992609)). Then work inside the container.

2. Initialize the workspace you will work on: `python3 intialize.py <your_student_id>`, e.g., `python3 intialize.py A123456N`. It's your capitalized student ID (not your NUSNET ID). 

3. Work on the translation. We have some notes that might be helpful as `README.md` files in `./workspace/short` and `./workspace/long`.

4. Write a concise report (maximum four pages) based on this template `./report.docx`. Export it as pdf and put the pdf file in the `./workspace` folder.

5. Submit: run `python3 submit.py`. It will create a zip file named `<your_student_id>_proj.zip` in the current folder. Submit this zip file to Canvas.
